This is a REST API Client, which required building a Java application that interacts with a public REST API, fetches data, and displays it in a structured format. This helped me understand the core concepts of web APIs, HTTP communication, and JSON data handling, which are essential skills for any backend or full-stack developer.

Real-World Applications of REST API Clients:
REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) have become the backbone of modern web and mobile applications. They allow communication between client and server over HTTP, enabling services to share data and functionality. A REST API client can be used in many real-world applications, such as:

1.Weather Applications: Display real-time weather updates by consuming APIs from services like OpenWeatherMap.
2.News Aggregators: Fetch and display the latest headlines from public news APIs.
3.E-commerce Platforms: Access product data, user orders, and payment information from a central server.
4.Travel Apps: Retrieve details about flights, hotels, and transportation using APIs from travel services.
5.Finance Trackers: Get real-time stock prices, currency exchange rates, or cryptocurrency data.
6.Social Media Integration: Pull user posts, likes, or messages from APIs like Twitter or Instagram.

These examples show that REST API clients are integral to dynamic data-driven applications used every day by millions

Tools and Technologies Used :

Programming Language: Java
IDE: VS Code 

This task significantly boosted my confidence in working with APIs and understanding real-time data integration. I learned:

1.The difference between HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2.How to handle API keys and security
3.How to work with JSON in Java
4.The importance of error handling for failed requests (e.g., 404 or 401 errors)
5.How modern applications pull live data from external sources

This is an eye-opener into the world of APIs and backend communication. REST APIs make applications dynamic, connected, and real-time. By completing this, I built a solid foundation in integrating web services into Java applications â€” a skill in high demand in the software development industry. It prepared me to work on more complex systems such as user authentication, cloud services, and microservices in the future.
